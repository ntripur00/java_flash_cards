    "What are the rules for method overloading in Java?": "The rules for method overloading in Java are: 1) The method must have the same name but different parameter lists. 2) The method can have different return types, but it is not considered in method overloading. 3) The method can have different access modifiers.",
    "What are the rules for method overriding in Java?": "The rules for method overriding in Java are: 1) The method must have the same name in subclass as in the parent class. 2) The method must have the same parameter list in subclass as in the parent class. 3) The 'is-a' relationship should exist (inheritance).",
    "What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding in Java?": "The main difference between method overloading and method overriding in Java is that overloading is the ability of a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters or types, while overriding is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its parent class.",
    "What is multithreading in Java?": "Multithreading in Java is a feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU. Each part of such a program is called a thread. Threads are light-weight processes within a process.",
    "What is a semaphore in Java?": "Semaphore is a class in Java that is used to control the number of threads accessing a particular resource. It maintains a set of permits for controlling the access. A thread can acquire a permit and release it once it's done using the resource.",
    "What are the different types of classes in Java?": "Java has several types of classes: 1) Concrete classes: These are regular classes that we can instantiate. 2) Abstract classes: We cannot instantiate these classes. They are used to provide a base for subclasses to extend. 3) Final classes: We cannot extend these classes. 4) Inner classes: These are classes that are defined within other classes.",
    "How does thread synchronization work in Java?": "Thread synchronization in Java is defined using 'synchronized' blocks. When a thread enters a synchronized block, it acquires the lock on the object the block is synchronized on. No other thread can enter a synchronized block on the same object until the lock is released by the first thread.",
    "What are the different ways to create a thread in Java?": "There are two main ways to create a thread in Java: 1) By extending the Thread class and 2) By implementing the Runnable interface.",
    "What are the states in the lifecycle of a thread in Java?": "A thread in Java can be in one of the five states: New, Runnable, Running, Non-Runnable (Blocked), and Terminated.",
    "How can we stop a thread in Java?": "In Java, we deprecate the use of stop() method to stop a thread because it is unsafe and can leave your program in an inconsistent state. It's usually better to use an exit flag, which is a variable that the thread periodically checks to determine whether it should exit.",
    "What is the difference between the Runnable and Callable interfaces in Java?": "Both Runnable and Callable interfaces represent tasks that can be executed by multiple threads in Java. The Runnable interface has a single method called run() and does not return a result. The Callable interface has a single method called call() and can return a result.",
    "What is the role of the join() method in Java?": "In Java, the join() method of a Thread class allows one thread to wait until another thread completes its execution. If t is a Thread object whose thread is currently executing, then t.join() will make sure that t is terminated before the next instruction is executed by the program.",
    "What is an Array in Java?": "In Java, an array is a dynamically created object that serves as a container to hold constant number of values of the same type. It is an object containing elements of similar data types. It is a data structure where we store similar elements.",
    "How do you declare an Array in Java?": "You can declare an array in Java using the following syntax: dataType[] arrayName; or dataType arrayName[];.",
    "What is the default value of the elements in an array in Java?": "For numeric types, the default value is 0; for boolean, it is false; and for object references, it is null.",
    "How do you initialize an array in Java?": "An array in Java can be initialized in several ways. One way is to initialize it at the time of declaration, like: int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4};. Another way is using the new keyword: int[] arr = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4};.",
    "What is the difference between a traditional for loop and a 'for-each' loop while iterating through an array?": "The traditional for loop is used when you need to iterate through the elements of an array using the index. The 'for-each' loop (also known as the 'enhanced for loop') is used when you want to iterate through the elements but you don't care about the index. The 'for-each' loop is less flexible but more convenient than a traditional for loop.",
    "What is a LinkedList in Java?": "LinkedList is a class in Java's collections framework which implements List and Deque interfaces. It is a linear data structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part.",
    "What are the main differences between ArrayList and LinkedList?": "ArrayList and LinkedList both implement List interface but have different underlying implementations. ArrayList is backed by an array, provides random access and is generally faster for lookup operations, but adding or removing elements can be slow as it may require shifting elements. LinkedList, on the other hand, is implemented as a doubly linked list, provides sequential access and is generally faster for add and remove operations.",
    "How do you add elements to a LinkedList?": "Elements can be added to a LinkedList using the add() method. This method appends the element to the end of the list. If you want to add an element at a specific position, you can use the add(index, element) method.",
    "How do you remove elements from a LinkedList?": "Elements can be removed from a LinkedList using the remove() method. This method removes the first occurrence of the specified element from the list. If you want to remove an element at a specific position, you can use the remove(index) method.",
    "What is the time complexity for adding or removing elements from a LinkedList?": "Adding an element to or removing an element from the start or end of a LinkedList takes constant time, O(1). However, adding or removing from a position in the middle takes linear time, O(n), as we need to traverse the list.",
    "What is recursion in Java?": "Recursion in Java is a process where a method calls itself continuously. A method in Java that calls itself is called a recursive method.",
    "How do you reverse a string using recursion in Java?": "A string can be reversed in Java using recursion by passing the substring of the original string from the second character onwards into the recursive method, until it reaches the base condition where the string length is less than or equal to 1. Then concatenate this with the first character of the string.",
    "What is bit manipulation in Java?": "Bit manipulation involves directly operating on the binary representations of numbers in Java. This can be done using bitwise operators, such as AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), and shift operators (<<, >>, >>>).",
    "Explain the quicksort algorithm.": "Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm which relies on a partition operation: to partition an array, an element called a pivot is selected. All elements smaller than the pivot are moved before it and all greater elements are moved after it. This can be done efficiently in linear time and in-place.",
    "What is a Map in Java?": "A Map in Java is a part of the Collections Framework and a member of the Java Collections Framework. It provides the basic operation of storing elements in key-value pairs and retrieving them efficiently based on the key.",
    "How does a HashMap work in Java?": "In a HashMap, the data is stored in key-value pairs. The key is hashed, and the resulting hash code is used as the index at which the value is stored within the table. When you want to access a value, you provide the key, the HashMap hashes it, and then looks for the value at the hash code index.",
    "What is the time complexity of quicksort for the worst-case scenario?": "The worst-case time complexity of quicksort is O(n^2). However, this scenario is not common, especially if the pivot is chosen wisely (e.g., always choosing the median as pivot).",
    "What is a StackOverflowError in Java?": "A StackOverflowError in Java is thrown to indicate that the application's stack depth has been exceeded, largely due to a large number of nested method calls or a recursive operation that has spiraled out of control.",
    "What is tail recursion?": "Tail recursion is a special kind of recursion where the recursive call is the final operation in the function. It's special because it can be optimized by the compiler to avoid the overhead of repeated function calls, effectively turning the recursion into a loop.",
    "Explain the merge sort algorithm.": "Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits an array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges them. This algorithm is known for its worst-case time complexity of O(n log n).",
    "What is the BitSet class in Java?": "The BitSet class creates a special type of array that holds bit values. This array can increase in size as needed. This makes it similar to a vector of bits.",
    "What are some advantages of using recursion in programming?": "Recursion can make code smaller and easier to read. It can also be useful for tasks that can be defined in terms of similar subtasks, such as traversing a tree data structure.",
    "What is the time complexity of adding an element into a LinkedList at a specified position?": "The time complexity is O(n) because in the worst case, we may need to traverse all elements.",
    "What is the time complexity of adding an element into an ArrayList at a specified position?": "The time complexity is O(n) because array elements may need to be shifted to make room for a new element.",
    "What is a Hashtable in Java?": "Hashtable is a part of the Java Collections Framework but it's considered legacy code. It's very similar to HashMap, but it's synchronized, which means only one thread can access the Hashtable at a point of time.",
    "How can you swap two numbers in Java without using a temporary variable?": "You can use arithmetic operators or bitwise XOR to swap two numbers without using a temporary variable.",
    "What is the difference between Comparator and Comparable in Java?": "Comparable interface is used to order the objects of the user-defined class. Comparator interface is used to order the objects of user-defined class when you have two objects to compare.",
    "What is the difference between '==' and 'equals()' in Java?": "'==' tests for reference equality. 'equals()' tests for value equality. Consequently, if you want to know if two strings have the same value you would use 'equals()'."
